# US Accidents Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project aims to explore and analyze a dataset containing information about traffic accidents in the United States. The dataset includes various attributes such as accident severity, location, weather conditions, and time of the accident. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the factors contributing to accidents and understand patterns and trends in accident occurrences.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and contains over 7 million records of traffic accidents in the US. It includes information such as accident severity, location coordinates, weather conditions, and time of the accident.

Dataset: [US Accidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)

## Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset underwent preprocessing to handle missing values, correct data types, and ensure consistency in the data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Various exploratory analyses were performed to understand the distribution of accidents by severity, location, time, weather conditions, and other factors.
3. **Visualization**: Visualizations such as bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots were used to represent the insights obtained from the data.
4. **Trend Analysis**: Trends in accident rates were analyzed daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly to identify patterns and fluctuations.

## Findings
- Majority of accidents occur during peak traffic hours, especially in the morning (7 am to 9 am) and evening (2 pm to 5 pm).
- Weekdays exhibit a higher accident rate compared to weekends.
- December had the highest number of accidents.
- The number of accidents has shown an increasing trend over the years.
- California has the highest number of accidents among all states.

## Future Work
- Predictive modeling: Develop machine learning models to predict accident severity or likelihood based on various features.
- Correlation analysis: Investigate correlations between different factors such as weather conditions, road features, and accident severity.
- Geospatial analysis: Explore spatial patterns of accidents using mapping techniques.
